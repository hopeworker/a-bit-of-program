# 软件开发工作中的英语日常积累

I can't tell you how confusing it was to me for a long time ago

we will do what we've been doing

maybe just post in dev as a courtesy

ad-hoc config

Looks about right

I was picturing it being kind of analogous to Kafka Rest Proxy

This is just out of curiosity more-so than as a real suggestion

i'm not sure if i'm barking up the wrong tree in terms of where i'm looking

thanks for all your time on this issue. even though wasn't sure what resolved it, it is nice to have another pair of eyes looking into it.

i slacked him just now

i'm not too fussed on the timeline of this ticket

someone is ahead of me

you mean parking is free until then?

Hey team, good to meet those of you that i haven't, i've recently transferred into #team-redis.
i'm currently working on fixing our implementation for collecting proxy metrics for redis mirroring so that we can alert on them, display to customers etc. 

during testing i've noticed that metrics are not being produced by proxy on a particular node until proxy has been queried on that specific node. specifically, running e.g. curl some-url on a node returns nothing until after that first query has occurred. 

i've discussed with him and from our perspective it would be preferable to start reporting metrics once the service starts - even if they aren't particularly important before proxy has been queried, it still helps us to know that metrics will be there, so that we can report to customers etc.

i'm wondering if this change (reporting metrics from service startup time onwards) could be raised as an issue for development on the proxy project, please?

i don't have access to the repo itself and so couldn't raise there, so posting here seemed the next best thing.
Thanks and let me know if i can provide any more information about the issue.

if there are outstanding issues on the rest of the cluster.

i'm fuzzy on exactly what it contains

oh neat, i hadn't realized jmap could do stuff other than just produce a heap dump.

also any chance you could tell me how you figured out the issue, so i could investigate something like this in the future?

let's just get this ticket done sooner than later

As a newly-minted Redis team member, all looks good to me

just hold off on the independent test for a little while


Find out about each family, ask questions.

Let's set the record straight.

bringing up old mistakes can get in the way of a solution

if only i could take a screenshot of my spinning beach ball on outlook

Closure is when a function remembers and continues to access variables from outside its scope, even when the function is executed in a different scope.

context-aware functions that are called without any context specified default the context to the global object
