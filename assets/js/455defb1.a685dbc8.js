even if they aren't particularly important before proxy has been queried, it still helps us to know that metrics will be there, so that we can report to customers etc.\n\ni'm wondering if this change (reporting metrics from service startup time onwards) could be raised as an issue for development on the proxy project, please?\n\ni don't have access to the repo itself and so couldn't raise there, so posting here seemed the next best thing.\nThanks and let me know if i can provide any more information about the issue.\n"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"if there are outstanding issues on the rest of the cluster."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"i'm fuzzy on exactly what it contains"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"oh neat, i hadn't realized jmap could do stuff other than just produce a heap dump."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"also any chance you could tell me how you figured out the issue, so i could investigate something like this in the future?"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"let's just get this ticket done sooner than later"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As a newly-minted Redis team member, all looks good to me"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"just hold off on the independent test for a little while"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Find out about each family, ask questions."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's set the record straight."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"bringing up old mistakes can get in the way of a solution"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"if only i could take a screenshot of my spinning beach ball on outlook"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Closure is when a function remembers and continues to access variables from outside its scope, even when the function is executed in a different scope."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"context-aware functions that are called without any context specified default the context to the global object"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"spot check logs"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"soz"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"meeting-notes",children:"Meeting notes"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Does this reflect our discussion accurately\uff1f"})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>a});var o=n(6540);const i={},s=o.createContext(i);function r(e){const t=o.useContext(s);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:r(e.components),o.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
